        If you want to display a QR code to the user, this is the URL that
        should be launched when the QR code is scanned (the URL that should
        be contained in the QR code image you generate).

        Whether you generate the QR code image or not is up to you, and the
        library can't do this for you due to the vast ways of generating and
        displaying the QR code that exist.

        Waits for the token to be imported by a previously-authorized client,
        either by scanning the QR, launching the URL directly, or calling the
        import method.

        This method **must** be called before the QR code is scanned, and
        must be executing while the QR code is being scanned. Otherwise, the
        login will not complete.

        Will raise `asyncio.TimeoutError` if the login doesn't complete on
        time.

        Arguments
            timeout (float):
                The timeout, in seconds, to wait before giving up. By default
                the library will wait until the token expires, which is often
                what you want.

        Returns
            On success, an instance of :tl:`User`. On failure it will raise.
