    Raw events are not actual events. Instead, they are the raw
    :tl:`Update` object that Telegram sends. You normally shouldn't
    need these.

    Args:
        types (`list` | `tuple` | `type`, optional):
            The type or types that the :tl:`Update` instance must be.
            Equivalent to ``if not isinstance(update, types): return``.

    Example
        .. code-block:: python

            from telethon import events
