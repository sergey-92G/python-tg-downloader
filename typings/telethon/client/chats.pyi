        Iterator over the participants belonging to the specified chat.

        The order is unspecified.

        Arguments
            entity (`entity`):
                The entity from which to retrieve the participants list.

            limit (`int`):
                Limits amount of participants fetched.

            search (`str`, optional):
                Look for participants with this string in name/username.

            filter (:tl:`ChannelParticipantsFilter`, optional):
                The filter to be used, if you want e.g. only admins
                Note that you might not have permissions for some filter.
                This has no effect for normal chats or users.

                .. note::

                    The filter :tl:`ChannelParticipantsBanned` will return
                    *restricted* users. If you want *banned* users you should
                    use :tl:`ChannelParticipantsKicked` instead.

            aggressive (`bool`, optional):
                Does nothing. This is kept for backwards-compatibility.

                There have been several changes to Telegram's API that limits
                the amount of members that can be retrieved, and this was a
                hack that no longer works.

        Yields
            The :tl:`User` objects returned by :tl:`GetParticipantsRequest`
            with an additional ``.participant`` attribute which is the
            matched :tl:`ChannelParticipant` type for channels/megagroups
            or :tl:`ChatParticipants` for normal chats.

                This is what the API calls "unban".

            ban (`bool`):

                be returned. This is what the API calls "kick" (restricting
                all permissions removed is a ban, which kicks the user).

        Returns a context-manager object to represent a "chat action".

        Chat actions indicate things like "user is typing", "user is
        uploading a photo", etc.

        If the action is ``'cancel'``, you should just ``await`` the result,
        since it makes no sense to use a context-manager for it.

        See the example below for intended usage.

        Arguments
            entity (`entity`):
                The entity where the action should be showed in.

            action (`str` | :tl:`SendMessageAction`):
                The action to show. You can either pass a instance of
                :tl:`SendMessageAction` or better, a string used while:

                * ``'typing'``: typing a text message.

                * ``'game'``: playing a game.
                * ``'location'``: choosing a geo location.
                * ``'sticker'``: choosing a sticker.
                * ``'record-audio'``: recording a voice note.
                  You may use ``'record-voice'`` as alias.
                * ``'record-round'``: recording a round video.
                * ``'record-video'``: recording a normal video.
                * ``'audio'``: sending an audio file (voice note or song).
                  You may use ``'voice'`` and ``'song'`` as aliases.
                * ``'round'``: uploading a round video.
                * ``'video'``: uploading a video file.
                * ``'photo'``: uploading a photo.
                * ``'document'``: uploading a document file.
                  You may use ``'file'`` as alias.
                * ``'cancel'``: cancel any pending action in this chat.

                Invalid strings will raise a ``ValueError``.

            delay (`int` | `float`):
                The delay, in seconds, to wait between sending actions.
                For example, if the delay is 5 and it takes 7 seconds to
                do something, three requests will be made at 0s, 5s, and
                7s to cancel the action.

            auto_cancel (`bool`):
                Whether the action should be cancelled once the context
                manager exists or not. The default is `True`, since
                you don't want progress to be shown when it has already
                completed.

        Returns
            Either a context-manager object or a coroutine.

            ban_users (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will be able to ban users.

            invite_users (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will be able to invite users. Needs some testing.

            pin_messages (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will be able to pin messages.

            add_admins (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will be able to add admins.

            manage_call (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will be able to manage group calls.

            anonymous (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will remain anonymous when sending messages.
                The sender of the anonymous messages becomes the group itself.

                .. note::

                    Users may be able to identify the anonymous admin by its
                    custom title, so additional care is needed when using both
                    ``anonymous`` and custom titles. For example, if multiple
                    anonymous admins share the same title, users won't be able
                    to distinguish them.

            is_admin (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user will be an admin in the chat.
                This will only work in small group chats.
                Whether the user will be an admin in the chat. This is the
                only permission available in small group chats, and when
                used in megagroups, all non-explicitly set permissions will
                have this value.

                Essentially, only passing ``is_admin=True`` will grant all
                permissions, but you can still disable those you need.

            title (`str`, optional):
                The custom title (also known as "rank") to show for this admin.
                This text will be shown instead of the "admin" badge.
                This will only work in channels and megagroups.

                When left unspecified or empty, the default localized "admin"

            entity (`entity`):
                The channel or megagroup where the restriction should happen.

            user (`entity`, optional):
                If specified, the permission will be changed for the specific user.
                If left as `None`, the default chat permissions will be updated.

            until_date (`DateLike`, optional):
                When the user will be unbanned.

                If the due date or duration is longer than 366 days or shorter than
                30 seconds, the ban will be forever. Defaults to ``0`` (ban forever).

            view_messages (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to view messages or not.
                Forbidding someone from viewing messages equals to banning them.
                This will only work if ``user`` is set.

            send_messages (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to send messages or not.

            send_media (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to send media or not.

            send_stickers (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to send stickers or not.

            send_gifs (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to send animated gifs or not.

            send_games (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to send games or not.

            send_inline (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to use inline bots or not.

            embed_link_previews (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to enable the link preview in the
                messages they send. Note that the user will still be able to
                send messages with links if this permission is removed, but
                these links won't display a link preview.

            send_polls (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to send polls or not.

            change_info (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to change info or not.

            invite_users (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to invite other users or not.

            pin_messages (`bool`, optional):
                Whether the user is able to pin messages or not.

        Returns
            The resulting :tl:`Updates` object.

            Attempting to kick someone who was banned will remove their
            restrictions (and thus unbanning them), since kicking is just
            ban + unban.

        Arguments
            entity (`entity`):
                The channel or chat where the user should be kicked from.

        Returns
            Returns the service `Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message>`

            This request has to fetch the entire chat for small group chats,

        Note that some restrictions apply before being able to fetch statistics,
        in particular the channel must have enough members (for megagroups, this
        requires `at least 500 members`_).

        Arguments
            entity (`entity`):

        Raises
            If the given entity is not a channel (broadcast or megagroup),
